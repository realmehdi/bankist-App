And indeeeed...my very first project with javascript and i am so excited about this.
Bankist stands fo minimalist banking, this app is kind of online bank interface.
we have all the movements, we have overall balance of the account, we have some summary data, and also we have 3 option that we can do such as:
-transfer money to someone else
-we can request loan from the bank
-and we can close the account
Finaly we can sort our movements and back to normal, we can switch to another account with username and password.
The thing is special about this app Is number and dates of each account is based on the internationalization API (Intl), here we have 2 account with iranian and american formating, and yeah, that’s cool.
One more thing is this app have backward timer and after a certain time, the program will stop.
I have used a bunch of array methods in this app, one object for each account and and we’re gonna pretend that all these data is coming from a web API.
I think it looks amazing, it also looks like real word use case and I’m really happy with this application.
